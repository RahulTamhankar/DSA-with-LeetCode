// You can remove (long) if you know that mid * mid will never get too big for int type.

// But sometimes, if x is a very big number (like close to 2,000,000,000), then:

// mid could be large (example: around 46,000),

// and mid * mid becomes a huge number â€” bigger than what an int can hold,

// so mid * mid can overflow and give a wrong answer.
